Accompanist is a group of libraries which contains some utilities which I've found myself copying around projects which use [Jetpack Compose][compose]. Currently it contains:

 * üé® [Material Design Components theme integration](./mdc-theme/README.md)
 * üñºÔ∏è [Coil image loading composables](./coil/README.md)

[Jetpack Compose][compose] is a fast moving project and I'll be updating these libraries to match the
latest tagged release as quickly as possible. Each [release listing](https://github.com/chrisbanes/accompanist/releases) will outline what version of Compose and the UI libraries it depends on.

## Download

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation "dev.chrisbanes.accompanist:accompanist-mdc-theme:<version>"
    implementation "dev.chrisbanes.accompanist:accompanist-coil:<version>"
}
```

Snapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype's `snapshots` repository][snap]. These are updated on every commit.

#### Why the name?

The library is all about adding some utilities around Compose. Music composing is done by a
composer, and since this library is about supporting composition, the supporting role of an [accompanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accompaniment) felt like a good name.
