New features & bugfixes \u00b6 All new features should be uploaded as PRs against the main branch. Once merged into main , they should be merged into the snapshot branch: git checkout main && git pull git checkout snapshot && git pull # Create branch for PR git checkout -b snapshot_main_merge # Merge in the main branch git merge main # Push to GitHub Jetpack Compose Snapshots \u00b6 We publish snapshot versions of Accompanist, which depend on a SNAPSHOT versions of Jetpack Compose. These are built from the snapshot branch. Updating to a newer Compose snapshot \u00b6 As mentioned above, updating to a new Compose snapshot is done by submitting a new PR against the snapshot branch: git checkout snapshot && git pull # Create branch for PR git checkout -b update_snapshot Now edit the project to depend on the new Compose SNAPSHOT version: Edit dependencies.kt : Update the Libs.AndroidX.Compose.snapshot property to be the snapshot number Ensure that the Libs.AndroidX.Compose.version property is correct Make sure the project builds and test pass: ./gradlew check Now git commit the changes and push to GitHub. Finally create a PR (with the base branch as snapshot ) and send for review. Releasing \u00b6 Once the next Jetpack Compose version is out, we're ready to push a new release: #1: Merge snapshot into main \u00b6 First we merge the snapshot branch into main : git checkout snapshot && git pull git checkout main && git pull # Create branch for PR git checkout -b main_snapshot_merge # Merge in the snapshot branch git merge snapshot #2: Update dependencies \u00b6 Edit dependencies.kt : Update the Libs.AndroidX.Compose.snapshot property to be an empty string ( val snapshot = \"\" ) Update the Libs.AndroidX.Compose.version property to the new Compose version ( 1.0.0-alpha03 for example). Make sure the project builds and test pass: ./gradlew check Commit the changes. #3: Bump the version number \u00b6 Edit gradle.properties : Update the VERSION_NAME property and remove the -SNAPSHOT suffix. Commit the changes, using the commit message containing the new version name. #4: Push to GitHub \u00b6 Push the branch to GitHub and create a PR against the main branch, and send for review. Once approved and merged, it will be automatically deployed to Maven Central. #5: Create release \u00b6 Once the above PR has been approved and merged, we need to create the GitHub release: Open up the Releases page. At the top you should see a 'Draft' release, auto populated with any PRs since the last release. Click 'Edit'. Make sure that the version number matches what we released (the tool guesses but is not always correct). Double check everything, then press 'Publish release'. At this point the release is published. This will trigger the docs action to run, which will auto-deploy a new version of the website . #6: Prepare the next development version \u00b6 The current release is now finished, but we need to update the version for the next development version: Edit gradle.properties : Update the VERSION_NAME property, by increasing the version number, and adding the -SNAPSHOT suffix. Example: released version: 0.3.0 . Update to 0.3.1-SNAPSHOT git commit and push to main .

These are updated on every commit to main . To do so: repositories { // ... maven { url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots' } } dependencies { // Check the latest SNAPSHOT version from the link above classpath 'dev.chrisbanes.accompanist:accompanist-coil:XXX-SNAPSHOT' } You might see a number of different versioned snapshots. If we use an example: 0.3.0-SNAPSHOT is a build from the main branch, and depends on the latest tagged Jetpack Compose release (i.e. alpha03 ). 0.3.0.compose-6574163-SNAPSHOT is a build from the snapshot branch. This depends on the SNAPSHOT build of Jetpack Compose from build 6574163 . You should only use these if you are using Jetpack Compose snapshot versions (see below). Using Jetpack Compose Snapshots \u00b6 If you're using SNAPSHOT versions of the androidx.compose libraries, you might run into issues with the current stable Accompanist release forcing an older version of those libraries. We publish snapshot versions of Accompanist which depend on recent Jetpack Compose SNAPSHOT repositories. To find a recent build, look through the snapshot repository for any versions in the scheme x.x.x.compose-YYYY-SNAPSHOT (for example: 0.3.0.compose-6574163-SNAPSHOT ). The YYYY in the scheme is the snapshot build being used from AndroidX (from the example: build 6574163 ). You can then use it like so: repositories { // ... maven { url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots' } } dependencies { // Check the latest SNAPSHOT version from the link above classpath 'dev.chrisbanes.accompanist:accompanist-coil:XXXX.compose-YYYYY-SNAPSHOT' } These builds are updated regularly, but there's no guarantee that we will create one for a given snapshot number.
